# Project Proposal

## Project Overview

I intend to use Three.js to create a model of a solar system in which planet revolves around the sun and provides camera in which the user can manipulate within the scene. The objects (planets, etc) will have, at minimum, texture mapped and/or lighting effects implmented.

## Project Schedule

Week 1 - Familiarize myself with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and including the API calls I will need to use in my program
Week 2 - Implement a basic scene, including events and camera manipulation
Week 3 - Build element API with the program to create/modify object in the scene
Week 4 - Implement light and/or texture mapping, apply final touches, and prepare presentation

## Project Technical Requirements

I intend to use Three.js and JavaScript.
