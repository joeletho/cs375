# Assignment 1

I have chosen [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) as my _inspiration_ for this week's assignment. ShaderToy hosts WebGL shaders developed by users within the community. This is really amazing, particlarly because it provides a haven for those who enjoy creating works of art using shaders and a community of others who appreciate the art and may also contribute their own work.

When I first opened the page and saw the "Shader of the week" I was blown away. [Hex Glitch](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lfscD7) was submitted by the user `igneus` and wow. Taking a look at the Common, Buffer A, Buffer B, and Image files that generate the program show (if it wasn't already obvious) how non-trival this shader is. I am truly impressed and even more excited to learn more about the techniques and nuances of computer graphics.
